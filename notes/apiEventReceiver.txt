Logic:
Calling the /trap API is not the same as an snmptrap.  This is really more of an Event API living at /trap

There is NO logic for inserting the event into the database.  All data must be set before calling this URL.


Testing possibilities:
curl -X POST -F 'endEvent=blah' -F 'evid=12345' -F 'device=fake' -F 'stateChange=2021-04-21 00:00:00'  -F 'eventAddress=""'  http://larvel01:8002/trap
curl -X POST -F 'eventAgeout=2600' -F 'eventCounter=2'  -F 'eventRaw=raw crap' -F 'eventReceiver=123' -F 'eventSeverity=0' -F 'eventAddress=""' -F 'eventDetails=""' -F 'eventProxyIp=""' -F 'eventName=name' \
-F 'eventType=blah' -F 'eventMonitor=dammit' -F 'eventSummary=blah' -F 'foo=bar' http://larvel01:8002/trap


/trap Events all will go into the database without exception.
Delete is only used to move from event >> history tables


1) This does not invoke the pre or post filtering like the snmptrap does.
2) There is no performance metric saved from values sent to this API.
3) The flow is all based on the severity value and matches against device + eventName.
4) This will either set the alarm or clear an existing one that is == device + eventName.
  a) Updates will change certain values, but not all of them
  b) Inserts will insert all posted values as POST gives
    i) Safties are in place to default values if they are not given
    ii) Default events are DEBUG level SET events if not given

* Sloppy POST statements will make things not work well.
1) Device is very important, even if it is not already defined in the database
2) EventName SHOULD be set or the default is unknown which will cause issues with set and clears
3) This API is really designed for adhoc events to be put into the database
  a) Pre filtering for events should call (if it exists yet) /trap/prefilter
  b) Post filtering for events should call (if it exists) /trap/postfilter
4) pre/post filters will be able to alter any event based against the name matching in the mapping table
  a) Pre filters will end up calling back the /trap URL with changes that it sets to insert into the database
  b) Post filters will internally update the database as the event database entry will already exist

Pollers are single thread, but multiple are allowed.


Housekeeping will alarm when a daemon monitored does not update within double its 
iteration time.

snmptrap working.
  - set and clear wrok
  - oid map works

web trap receiver working
  - set and clear work
  - currently there is NO pre_insert remapping or any mapping at all.

Daemons can be split better into their own directory structure
  - This includes the class include files in app/

Logging works, but is a little dirty

Graphite inserts non-functional currently
  - basic class has been created
  - create script to start inserts

RRDtool inserts are completely non-functional currently

Still need eventing off of metrics such as Graphite and RRDtool




Need to build still:
  - UI
  - syslog
  - export to kibana / ELK
  - adhoc moniitor against URLs (recommend slow iteration system)
    - see if you can leverage the curl class you just wrote
  - create your tree database from example: db tree on 192.168.15.250
  - email parsing and eventing
    - set and clears
    - should use unique oids or name values for filtering
  - log rotation
    - make this a housekeeping process that fires once a day
  - shell exec nagios plugins including NRPE (critical for small businesses)
  - leverage the Curl class to call out to things such as pager-duty, etc.
  - setup email outbound system for users
  - create users and authentication
    - cookies so we do not hammer on the db all the time
    - investigate redis to hold live creds


  - documentation on logic and flows
  - more scripts to test different parts better

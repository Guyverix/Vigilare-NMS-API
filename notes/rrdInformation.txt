Looks like with testing RRD rendering we can do about 10 images per second with current config and load.

Currently running average of 5% load with minimal IO wait.
77 images takes about 7 seconds on average
This is testing against 48 port switch with simple rrd graph command


Current config:
KVM: LVM 100GB partition.  KVM running on NFS mount as well.
2 cores / 2 GB RAM

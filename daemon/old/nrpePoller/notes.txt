Stop nrpe server
- update nrpe.config
- start server
- test
- path for nrpe V1 hard set in nrpePoller.php
- V2 will have a config file to set pathing later on..


/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_nrpe -c check_crond -H 192.168.15.58

Dupe this with exec.
- extreme caution must be used here so that quotes do not get hammered
- document this well as escaping stuff is a PITA and err prone

This will have to thread like crazy just like shellPoller..

No more than 50 threads would be safest I think..

Watch exits, and update as appropriate..

This is going to have the ability for args, so make sure the database has the extra necessary column..

Hosts will be an array!  

order of operations:
  get list as array
  get list of hosts FROM the retrieved array
  create fresh array with all hosts as discrete
  Walk array
  thread out (fork)  // this will allow the forks to have access to existing connections
  - OK or FAIL sends events
  - update event
  - update metrics
  - fork dies at completion
  start next in list
  rinse and repeat




Version 2, logic to know when to send an OK to the event receiver:
  pull list of hosts with active events
  if host is found THEN send clears for all checks for that specific host
  If host not found dont hammer the db for no reason


So far with version one, we are looking at 10 checks per second (est).  This assumes all is well.
When there is no response, this will be MUCH lower, and needs to be accounted for.

This is really simple..

###_someName.sql

The database tracks the ### value, and will not reinstall something that has already been installed.

This is a safety net so that you do not clobber existing values by running the installer again.

If you DO need to manually do this, then delete the ### from the database, or leverage the -F switch in the
installer script with a specific filename given.

Notes and reminders for testing...

add <app>.service into /etc/systemd/system/

systemctl daemon-reload

systemctl enable <app>.service

systemctl start <app>.service

Not sure on this one, I could have sworn that most of the files under systemd were symlinks to  /lib/systemd/system/ but maybe that is only OS itself and apps are real files..

This is going to be a catchall area for oddball scripts that are used within the application.

Anything that can be called as an exec has a home here.  In general these scripts themselves
are not going to log anything, or do database manipulation.  They should just
be used when we have to get around the limitations of the framework or when
a human should be able to duplicate what the application is doing manually.

This is the Action route that is going to add information into the following

database
databaseValue
graphite
rrd
influxdb
textFile
? something else ?
none

Depending on which one is called, the same data can end up in multiple places
for a variety of reasons.

  Post data for this call:

  $storeResults->url = $apiHost . ":" . $apiPort . "/storage";
  $storeResults->method="post";
  $storeResultsData['storage']  = $storage;
  $storeResultsData['hostname'] = $hostname;
  $storeResultsData['result']   = $result;
  $storeResultsData['value']    = $value;


storage: type
hostname: FQDN(current), or id number (future)
result: complete resultset (generally for database, or textFile
value:  The value to save to a given storage engine


local paths for files:
MAIN + /src/Storage/
  - rrd/<hostname | id>/<hostname>_<component>_<subcomponent>.rrd
  - textFile/<hostname | id>/<hostname>_<component>_<subcomponent>.txt


Database storage:
table performance;

Grapite Storage:
NMS is prefixed in the class call itself.

Hostnames are changed before sending to the class, as it has no concept of a hostname
YOU must preg_replace periods with underbars for hostnames OR IP addresses.

Grapite delimiters are periods, never forget that or your metric data will
not be able to be found in searches.

Example: guyver-office_iwillfearnoevil_com.component.dataName 34
nms/<FQDN \ id>/<checkName | component>/<componentValues>


None storage:
This is simply a sink that can be called with the data that could go
elsewhere.
Calling this will return the data you sent.

This route is going to be specific to dealing with database table trapEventMap

This will allow a CRUD system
Create Retrieve Update Delete

The frontend GUI is going to have to do some basic validation to make sure that the PHP is at least syntatically correct.

Values we are going to be working with:
oid
display_name
severity
pre_processing
type
parent_of
child_of
age_out
post_processing

This is where an SNMP trap is mapped to known values, and other manipulation is done.

oid may be renamed to something else at a later date, and then simply have this be the whole mapper no matter what is used.

oid is the critical match, as everything hangs off of this value.

There can be ONLY one match, either an exact match, OR unknown.  that is all.



Stubbed and unused:
parent_of
child_of
type
post_processing

Anything that is defined as a "default" can be overwritten in the pre_processing




SQL:
CREATE TABLE `trapEventMap` (
 `oid` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
 `display_name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL,
 `severity` tinyint(6) DEFAULT NULL,
 `pre_processing` text,
 `type` int(9) DEFAULT NULL,
 `parent_of` text,
 `child_of` text,
 `age_out` varchar(32) DEFAULT NULL,
 `post_processing` text,
 UNIQUE KEY `oid` (`oid`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB

This is going to be called via API..

There can be only one active ticketing system at a time.  Cant see a reason for more than one, TBH..

The event being ticketed will the evid

If we want to APPEND to a ticket, we will have to give the ticket number

Dont forget most ticketing systems require auth of some kind..  We have to have that set.

path (todo): POST
ticket/create/{evid}
ticket/update/{evid}/{ticket}

POST data will consist of the userid from the cookie
Optional: ack event when ticketed.

Database will query and get all columns for row matching evid

Template will be used to create a pretty ticket and put in as much data as the template asks for.

Proposed:
  * subject  $event_summary
  * body     $event_details
  * userid   $_COOKIE['userid']

temlate can have logic internal to it that will be specific to the ticketing system.  Much like the mapping, we can do case or if
clauses based on the values returned and set additional values to be sent to the ticketing system.

This will be highly reliant on what the filters do in the template.  The template can NEVER alter an event.

It WILL append in the additional table the ticket number and trigger the additional flag

The additional table consists of
notes
ack
ticket
evid

this can only be appended to, not changed normally....
This will require use of a new api likely event/additional/???


this is just spitball right now

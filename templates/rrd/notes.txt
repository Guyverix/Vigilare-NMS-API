Quick and dirty notes for the templates to create the RRD files..

99% of the time anything done outside of SNMP will be of type gauge.

SNMP itself has many data types, unless explicit counter is defined in a walk test, use gague.

Always walk the oid you are building the template for manually, and notice when you get stuff like 4096 bytes as you are going to have
to strip out the string bytes, as well as the whitespace.

The other RRD supported types CAN be used by people who know exactly what they are attempting to build but
will likely be mostly unused.

This template will likely be the "standard" for defining an RRD database metric.
  template_rrd_ifName_64.php
  template_rrd_1.3.6.1.2.1.25.2.3.1.php

Currently RRD will attempt checkName and then checkAction to find a template file...


A skel file has been made based on the above file with additional notes.

1) uses SNMP
2) this example has an index to loop through
3) Additional metrics are stored in the database that we can pull on graph generation but are not generally needed


template logic:
1) get data to work on
2) find a unique identifiable index "thing" (name to use)
3) Iterate over the table and pull out metrics we care about.
  a) Give metrics names < 19 characters (rrd limit)
  b) Define the metric type: "COUNTER", "GAUGE", "DCOUNTER", "DERIVE", "DDERIVE", "ABSOLUTE", "COMPUTE"
  c) Define a name such as "INVALID" for things we never want to attempt to stuff into the rrd.
4) Define our RRD window (I like cycle time * 3)
5) Define the file destination using information known in the script: hostname, checkName (or a generic name)
  a) Make sure to explicitly call out _32 or _64 when dealing with counter data in the file name
6)  Build create rrd command
7) Build update rrd command
8) Glue array together.

End result should look like this:
Array
( 
  [NAME] => Array
  (
    [fileName] => test.foo.bar.iwillfearnoevil.com/snmp/drive/space/_run_snapd_foo_32.rrd
    [create] => DS:hrStorageType:GAUGE:900:0:U DS:hrStorageUnit:GAUGE:900:0:U DS:hrStorageSize:GAUGE:900:0:U DS:hrStorageUsed:GAUGE:900:0:U 
    [update] => N:4:4096:1442162:398
  )
  [ANOTHER_NAME] => Array
  (
    [fileName] => test.foo.bar.iwillfearnoevil.com/snmp/drive/space/_run_snapd_blah_32.rrd
    [create] => DS:hrStorageType:GAUGE:900:0:U DS:hrStorageUnit:GAUGE:900:0:U DS:hrStorageSize:GAUGE:900:0:U DS:hrStorageUsed:GAUGE:900:0:U 
    [update] => N:4:4096:1442162:398
  )
)

* Notice specifically the different filenames, even if they have the same storage data names this is in fact valid.
* The above will create 1 rrd file for each [NAME] with the defined DS:NAMES as set in the create.
* RRDtool is really grouchy on whitespace.  Use caution and strip out all white in the update every time.

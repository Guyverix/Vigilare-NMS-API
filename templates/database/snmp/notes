All that should happen in here is to make the result set pretty as possible for storage within the database

All returns should be a k => v array and it will get converted to JSON before insertion

What we DO try to do  here is make sure the k string is something that makes sense for the UI to display

Strongly encourage a camelCase key name for this.  It is more universal in making sure stuff does not break.

You CAN use spaces, but I would discourage it as quotes and other junk can sneak  with raw data and cause headaches


SO KEEP THIS AS CLEAN AS POSSIBLE, SO YOUR GUI LOOKS GOOD WITH THE DATA RETURNED
